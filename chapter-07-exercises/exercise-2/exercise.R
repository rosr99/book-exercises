# Exercise 2: indexing and filtering vectors

# Create a vector `first_ten` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using 
# the : operator)

first_ten <- c(10:20)
print(first_ten)

# Create a vector `next_ten` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the 
# seq() function)

next_ten <- c(seq(21,30))
print(next_ten)

# Create a vector `all_numbers` by combining the previous two vectors

all_numbers <- c(first_ten + next_ten)
print(all_numbers)

# Create a variable `eleventh` that contains the 11th element in `all_numbers`

eleventh <- all_numbers[11]
print(eleventh)

# Create a vector `some_numbers` that contains the 2nd through the 5th elements 
# of `all_numbers`

some_numbers <- all_numbers[2:5]
print(some_numbers)

# Create a vector `even` that holds the even numbers from 1 to 100

even <- c(seq(1,100,2)+1)
print(even)

# Using the `all()` function and `%%` (modulo) operator, confirm that all of the
# numbers in your `even` vector are even

isEven <- all(even %% 2 == 0)
print(isEven)

# Create a vector `phone_numbers` that contains the numbers 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9

phone_numbers <- c(8,6,7,5,3,0,9)
print(phone_numbers)

# Create a vector `prefix` that has the first three elements of `phone_numbers`

prefix <- phone_numbers[1:3]
print(prefix)

# Create a vector `small` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
# less than or equal to 5

small <- phone_numbers[phone_numbers <= 5 & !is.nan(phone_numbers)]
print(small)

# Create a vector `large` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
# strictly greater than 5

large <- phone_numbers[phone_numbers > 5 & !is.nan(phone_numbers)]
print(large)

# Replace the values in `phone_numbers` that are larger than 5 with the number 5

phone_numbers <- replace(phone_numbers, phone_numbers > 5, 5)
print(phone_numbers)

# Replace every odd-numbered value in `phone_numbers` with the number 0

phone_numbers[phone_numbers %% 2 != 0] <- 0
